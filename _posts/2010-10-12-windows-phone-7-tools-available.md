Finally, much hyped [windows phone 7 OS mobile phones](http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F9rw0d3&h=fbc60) is available to the market. So is the RTMed version of the windows phone developer tools.

Currently they have only the online version of the installer available for [download](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=185584).

Windows phone 7 application is built on SilverLight platform which provides great UI. Hope to see more apps developed on this platform.
