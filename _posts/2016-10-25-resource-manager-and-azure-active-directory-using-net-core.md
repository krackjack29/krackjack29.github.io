# Resource Manager And Azure Active Directory using .Net Core

<p>I just published a github <a href="https://github.com/pratapbhaskar/azure-resource-manager-active-directory" target="_blank">repository</a> containing .Net core web application to authenticate Azure Resource Manager APIs and gain access to resources in other subscriptions.</p> <p>This solution is built in the same lines of solution proposed by Microsoft, <a title="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-manager-api-authentication/" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-manager-api-authentication/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-manager-api-authentication/</a> , which was built on ASP.Net MVC.&nbsp; </p> <p>There were some interesting learning while building it </p> <ul> <li>Dependency Injection in .Net Core</li> <li>OpenIdConnect middleware in .Net Core</li> <li>Custom Middleware </li></ul> <p>- Happy Coding!!!</p>
