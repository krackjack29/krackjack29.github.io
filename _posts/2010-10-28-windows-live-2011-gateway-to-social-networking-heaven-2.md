The latest version of [Live Essentials 2011](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials?os=other) is out and it’s a single gateway to social networking. They have integrated MSN messenger with Facebook, LinkedIn and MySpace.

the new essentials have Micorsoft’s signature ribbon styled UI and is very quick,

**Messenger** : Users can chat with their facebook friends and view their updates all with single login

**Photo Gallery** – Used to organize, upload (To the social media) and search for photos on your pc

**Writer** – It’s the best tool to write blogs, I use it and recommend people to use it

Mesh: Access the stuff on your computers from almost anywhere

Honestly microsoft has done well with essentials, only negativity is this version doesn’t run on XP or lower version.
